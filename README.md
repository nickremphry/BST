# BST
This is a Binary Search Tree created as an assignment for the course Data Structures II while studying at Webster University.

In conjunction with the BST, this repository also holds Node.h, Student.h, and StudentList.cpp:
  Node.h is for the creation of the Node object, as this binary search tree is made from a linked list of Nodes.
  Student.h is the creation of the student object to simulate a real world object that has multiple aspects.
  StudentList.cpp is the driver function that combines all the files together into one cohesive program where the user
       can add, search, update, delete, and display all students in a student.txt file.
       
  Note: I would attach the original student.txt file used in this assignment, however after a hard drive failure and no longer having access to my Webster student account,
        I do not have the original file.
